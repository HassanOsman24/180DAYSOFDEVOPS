  Hi, my name is Hassan and I will be documenting my journey into Devops! 
  I will be starting this journey on 04/04/2022 and wiil hopefully land my first job in Devops by 04/10/2022. Lets gooo!!!
The main reason why I have decided to document my journey is to give others who want to break into Devops an insight. I also want people to take something away from this and enhance their resources.
The goal will be to cover the main areas in Devops to a good level. 
In each section I will cover one main area and its importance in Devops. I will refer to it as the 'The Big picture' its alwats good to view each topic as the bigger picture. 
Please note that these are all my learning notes, I may make a few mistakes here and there but thats the beauty of learning.
