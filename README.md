# 180DaysOfDevOps

Hello world! My name is Hassan and today I will begin documentating my journey into Devops! I will look to secure a Devops position in the next 6 months!

The main reason I have chosen to document this journey is becuase I would like to give others who would like to break into Devops any insight. I also want people to take something away from this and enhance their resources.

The goal is to learn all the main topics in Devops to a sound level. 

In each section I will cover one main area and its importances in Devops. I will refer to it as 'The Bigger Picture' in Devops its good practice to view things with the bigger picture in mind.

Please note these are all my learning notes, I may make a few mistakes here and ther but thats the beauty of learning. 
## Progress
